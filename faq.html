                        We recommend booking your photo booth rental at least 2-3 months in advance, especially for popular wedding dates during peak season (May through October). However, we can often accommodate last-minute bookings if availability permits. A $100 deposit secures your event date. For weddings in <a href="/toronto">Toronto</a>, <a href="/mississauga">Mississauga</a>, or other GTA locations, early booking ensures you get your preferred date.
